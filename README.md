# Introduction to quantitative methods for economists

This repository contains the script for the course Quantitative Methods for Economists that I am teaching in the Winter Term at the Berlin School of Economics and Law (HWR Berlin). The course and the script covers roughly the following topics:

- The necessary R syntax
- Introduction to *rmarkdown* and the *tidyverse* (*ggplot2*, *dplyr* and *tydr* package in particular) with applications using macroeconomic data
- A review of maths and statistics with some basic exercises and simulations in R
- Fundamental concepts in econometrics with a focus on the linear regression
- Application of regression analysis to macroeconomic questions (e.g. estimation of the Keynesian consumption function, estimation of the Okun coefficient, ...)
